# Reads in a 10 characters account number and outputs the account number with last 4 numbers showing
# the first 6 characters replaced with Xs

# First I thought that if function [0:4] print first 4 digits, so I can use function with [6:0] and print me last 4
# I received no answer because in python (now, I know), first index must be lower.
