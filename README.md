# Pands-weekly-tasks
by Joanna Mnich

# 1. Introduction
This week's task aims to improve understanding of fundamental programming and scripting ideas. 
My objective was to gain a strong foundation in writing clear, effective code and to understand how to analyze issues into smaller, more manageable pieces.

By finishing this work, I will improve my writing of scripts that carry out particular tasks, automate repetitive procedures, and use best programming practices to solve real-world issues.
